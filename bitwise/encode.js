WALK-THROUGH
var puzzleEncoded = 1 << blackSquare | 1 << 5 | 1 << blackSquareF;
console.log('puzzleEncoded', puzzleEncoded); // 1073741984
HOW:
7 = bin 10000000, dec 128, 1 << 7, exponentially 2*2*2*2*2*2*2, so "2 power of 7"
5 = bin 00100000, dec 32, 1 << 5, ..
128 + 32 = 160
| is same as + i.e. 1 + 1 is 1 | 1
30 = bin 1000000000000000000000000000000, dec 1073741824, 1 << 30, so "2 power of 30" (big)
NOTE: above 30 bits..MAX in JS is 32
1073741824 + 160 = 1073741984 (puzzleEncoded)
